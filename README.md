# Rock, Paper, Scissors

### Source

I did this project as a part of The Odin Project, a great free website that is meant to aggregate all the resources necessary to go from zero knowledge to a web developer. Can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/

### Why this project?

This was one of my first projects that explored the logic of javascript in a web development format. Learned critical thinking for basic logic along with integrating that logic to be displayed on an html webpage.
